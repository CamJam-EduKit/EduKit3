The code contained within this repository is for use with the CamJam Edukit 3 - Robotics, created by the organisers of The Cambridge Raspberry Jam (http://camjam.me), an event for fans of the Raspberry Pi.

There are two versions of the instructions:

* GPIO Zero - using the easy-to-use GPIO Zero library to control the GPIO Pins
* RPi.GPIO - the original and more complex way of controlling GPIO Pins. These worksheets are no longer supported; we advise you to use the GPIO Zero versions.

The kit costs only Â£20 including UK VAT, and is available from [The Pi Hut](http://thepihut.com/collections/camjam-edukit)
